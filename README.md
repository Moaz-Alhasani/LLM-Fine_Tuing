# Fine-Tuning and Text Generation Using Transformers  

This repository demonstrates how to use the `transformers` library by Hugging Face for various NLP tasks, including text generation, question answering, tokenization, and fine-tuning a BERT model on the IMDb dataset for sentiment analysis.

## **Project Overview**
This project covers:
1. **Text Generation** using `distilgpt2`
2. **Question Answering** using a pretrained model
3. **Tokenization** with `bert-base-uncased`
4. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing** with the `datasets` library
5. **Fine-Tuning a BERT Model** for sentiment classification
6. **Training a Model with Trainer API**
7. **Saving and Loading Fine-Tuned Models**

## **Setup**
Ensure you have all dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install transformers datasets

ðŸ“Œ Note
This code is designed for educational purposes and can be further optimized for production use.

ðŸš€ Happy Fine-Tuning!
This README provides a **clear and structured explanation** of the code, including:
âœ… **Step-by-step breakdown**  
âœ… **Installation instructions**  
âœ… **Code snippets for each section**  
âœ… **References for further reading**
